#Personality

#Overview

#Create an interactive Python-based personality quiz that categorizes users into different personality types based on their responses to a series of questions. The quiz should be fun, engaging, and provide meaningful feedback at the end.

    #Questionnaire Design:
        #Create a list of at least 5 questions. Each question should have multiple-choice answers (at least 3-4 options per question).
        #The questions should aim to reveal the user's preferences, habits, or traits (e.g., "How do you handle stressful situations?" or "What's your favorite way to spend a weekend?").

    #Personality Types:
        ##Define 3 to 5 different personality types (e.g., "The Adventurer", "The Thinker", "The Social Butterfly", etc.).
        #Map responses to specific personality types by assigning points or weights to each answer. At the end of the quiz, the userâ€™s answers should determine which personality type they match.

    #Interactive Input:
        #The quiz should be fully interactive, taking input from the user and presenting them with questions one at a time.

   # Quiz Results:
        #After the quiz, display a summary of the user's personality type with a brief description (3-4 sentences) that explains their result.

# code created by Finch Stanger
# purpose: code will send user through a personality test to assess their personality
